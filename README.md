## Problem Title
Interactive Web Platform for Selector-Applicant Role Simulation

## Problem Description
Background: The recruitment process is a critical aspect of organizational success, but traditional selection methods often lack realism, efficiency, and interactivity. To address this, there is a growing need for a web-based solution that allows both applicants and selectors (interviewers, recruiters, or evaluators) to participate in a simulated, real-time, role-based interaction. This system should simulate real-world recruitment environments, allowing selectors to evaluate candidates more effectively while giving applicants a realistic preview of the selection process.

## Idea
1. Role-Based Simulation Platform
Develop a web platform enabling real-time, role-based simulations between selectors (recruiters) and applicants (candidates) for training and assessment.

2. Custom Scenario Creation
Allow selectors to design and deploy industry-specific scenarios such as interviews, group discussions, or problem-solving tasks.

3. Live Interaction Tools
Integrate chat, video conferencing, whiteboards, and file sharing for seamless selector-applicant communication during simulations.

4. Performance Evaluation System
Include scoring rubrics, automatic tracking of responses, and manual feedback input to assess applicant performance fairly and consistently.

5. Analytics & Reporting Dashboard
Provide detailed analytics for selectors to review applicant trends and for applicants to track personal growth over time.

6.Secure and Scalable Architecture
Ensure data security with encrypted sessions and scalable architecture to support institutions or organizations of varying sizes.
